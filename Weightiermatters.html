      <img src="weightiermatters.jpg" alt="image not found" style="width:50%;" id="right">
      <pre>
        It concerns the greatest treasure
        Not to be bargained for moments pleasure
        Which in tripartite man is not measured?
        You have a soul to save
        There is a hell to escape
        A terrible place of pain.
        There is a heaven to gain
        Where you do not need money
        Now is the good time to start the journey
        To a prepared place for prepared people
        Though, trouble and in life disabled
        The shore of paradise conveys security
        Salvation and righteousness attributes of spiritual maturity,
        Are stepping stones to God.
        There is a way, broad and smooth
        The other, narrow and straight
        One leads to life and glory
        The other to death and gloom
        Brace not yourself to stand the blows of divine truth
        It may smart and sting, but it heals and recovers
        Don’t take the broad way that seems right,
        For sin has blinded your eyes, warp your judgment
        It is a religious road that leads to hell
        Take the Calvary road that leads to life
        It ostratizes and buries you with worthy few
        There are many ways to hell, but one way to God
        There are many books of men but only one word of God
        Man has many remedies for sin, God has one the blood of Jesus
        Religious works abound, only one work saves
        Christ is the way and not a plan or creed
        People may embrace  his person and deeds
        Doctrines makes one to be as dead as a door post
        But practice of the gospel
        Is like a living fish fearing neither tide nor current
        In living a life devoid of sin, in a world of sin
        Like a saltless fish, in a salty sea.

      <img src="sin.jpeg" alt="image not found" style="width:50%;" id="right">
      <pre>
        Formed and fashioned by satan
        It has many a man and woman
        Entangled under his throes
        Hear now or all you lads
        That is feeling so bad
        It is a cancer of the soul
        A nagging thorn in the flesh
        And nibbling constant cares
        The right path is narrow and even
        Its path is broad of evil
        Arthful in a cunny way
        Subtle in a rational way
        Many a life are bristled with woes
        Consequence on sinful nature
        Which is attended with ineveitable hour
        The toll that sins takes in man’s life
        Surpasses every twinkling of eyes
        Brainwashingly, to you it says.
        Just eat and drinkn and merry be
        Forget tomorrow life is carefree
        Stay up late in revel tonight
        And make yourself to girls a sight
        Lo! I say, you will realize with a start
        Even as your body and soul are apart
        And being justly sentenced to hell
        Choose now the good way known
        And it will take you to heaven your home
        Salvation is a treasure never let it go
        Sin is no pleasure
        Though satan tells you so
        Though many had tried it
        Lo! Don’t try its bitter taste
        For too late they find it living their life a waste
        Sin in revel has many a purse drained
        Having clouded man’s thinking.
        Behold much taint their breath
        Insanely with wages of sin-death
        Satan makes sin the bait of his trap
        Throwing it to the mind, a swift dart
        Blend attractive to catch the eyes
        Caught are slaves they know not why
        To be saved from it you hear them cry
        Now come to Christ and get excused
        For having had your life abused

      <pre>
        Respectfully and wonderfully created
        With equitable  triune nature
        Made in the image of God
        But spoilt by the treachery of evil
        Man, Whom God breath the breath of life
        But satan the breath of hell.
        The spiritual reality in him
        Is poised between two worlds
        The daughter of man beguile by mortal foe
        Roves the street  to fill their purse
        And are condemn to groan.
        Come back to Him whose love is unfathomable
        And be vouch safe out of His mercy
        Before it comes, the inevitable hour
        His blood bought love liberate the filthy.
        Like king Solomon I assert mine
        Go to the ants thou o man
        Consider it's ways and be thou wise
        In this will you overcome the mortal foe
        Who has got many under his throes

      <pre>
        Born sinner by nature and by practice
        Encumbered and clothed in its vice
        We are living in trouble times
        Life is a puzzle to come by
        The pieces just fall in places
        Having to trade our soul for moment riches
        We have found ourselves in spiritual
        Kindergarten where bewild infants
        Are spelling God with the wrong blocks
        Lo! We can't make head or tail of life
        Is there light in his shroulded earth
        Of uncertainty chaos and fertility
        We have fallen to God penal offence
        By sin the root cause of our fraity
        Ah we are undone to whom shall we have recourse
        Glory! The light of the lord is dawn on us
        Jesus is the way the truth
        All our sins to him we spread to get absolution by his blood shed
        Fret not my soul
        So long God with us
        The storm shall rage
        And never can we be swayed
        In Christ we are too enthusiastic
        To be chilled and daunted by setback
        Come what may in this transistory word
        We shall stand through thick and thin in Christ
        From the stormy blast and raging tempest,
        He guides us through the maze of life
        Victoriously against the mortal foes
        Put this in mind also

        Man lives in tears and persecutions
        Persecution vis-à-vis temptation
        Is the Christians spiritual examination?
        And victoriously their spiritual promotion
        Every now and then it comes to us a test of faith
        For lo! It is half the battle to overcome in life
        With surprise, siege, strategy and subtility
        The antics and tactics of satan
        But I know that God is with me
        The storm of life shall spent itself
        And I will remain anchored in Christ
        So long as my vision of him is not chilled and daunted
        Come what may in this transistory world
        Over the insidious attacks of satan
        I shall stand through thick and thin in Christ

      <img src="die.jpg" alt="image not found" style="width:50%; height:400px" id="right">
      <pre>
        This is the prophecy to those to be born
        This is the biography of those who has been born
        This is a divine decree: “…men once to die…”
        This bible decree is confirmed by bible chronology
        “…and he died.” Reccorded monotonously and morbidly.
        Methuselah’s epitaph as recorded in the bible
        Reads the same as his shorter lived brethren-“and he died”
        All of adams race died
        They died of an age in all ages
        Death is the greatest day to Christians
        And a time of eternal torment for sinners
        You may be avowed atheist
        A blantant blasphemer
        A calloused and cocky Christ rejector
        A deceived deluded denier of the “the victor”
        After death you will go to hell, being rejected
        Are you looking where you are going?
        Are you going where you are looking?
        Are you looking and going to heaven?
        The yonder celestial haven!
        Know that where you are looking!
        Determines where you are going!

        It is going along nibbling on constant cares
        The lfe is irritating more often than pleasing
        Timorous more often often than calm
        It is being disturb, pertube and frankly frustrated
        The sinner devoid of their life vaguest impression
        Swim and wallow in a sea of sin
        This they do without the faintest idea
        Sinners pride on vague control of their life
        But you can bet this
        They will reap their wages – death
        As satan the goblin will halt their breath
        Sin bodg’s man down in a morals of thraldom
        The sinners problem boils down to sin
        And there are several spot of human nature
        Iniquity of the heart, a sin of bastard variety
        Brings a life of muddling living.
        Transgressor the law breaker
        Abomination a taboo commited
        Satan makes offers purporting sin’s pleasure
        The nostrums and quackery’s of evil measure
        That stinks and swamps the sinners
        Living in sin is the bread and butter of satan
        Serving to cement the chronicity of hell-to-earth
        No limit to the variety and nuisance of it’s art
        It wipes the sinner out of house and savings
        With business venture going to the wall
        Living in sin makes satan camp on your trail
        Bringing confounded nuisance to you in trivail
        As you surmise its tactic pians
        In your life might and main
        Living in sin is a life
        Tensed, discouraged forlorn and futile
        It's laudable benefit is artificial jolly
        Dithered and devoid of anything holy
        Sin nips life in the bud before it blooms
        Bringing a life devoid of sparkle and luster
        Give your life to Christ and be free from the mortal foes

      <pre>
        Jesus turned water to ‘oinos’ – sweet grape juice
        It is different from shekar’ – strong drinks
        This has been a bone of contention
        A hive and pedestal for elevated discourse
        Lo! For ages liquor is the poison taken by men
        That steal away their brains and brawns
        They drink themselves tipsy and run amok
        An unmitigated evil difficult to do away.
        Drunkenness clouds the intellect and fogs the brain
        Making them worst than useless drags in society
        Listen friends! “it is more destructive than wars
        It is the devil in solution
        Ah! It is distilled damination
        Many a man has err due to false vision
        Its luck is proverbial for it fickleness
        A cancer also in human society
        On the quick sand of morbid superiority
        It anchors the inebriates
        Alas eating out their vitals
        The most tacit method of assassination
        Ever evented by any age or nation
        It has killed lots than all wars of nations
        It is the raging mocker that deceives
        Those that imbibe it invite and welcome tragedy
        For it brings sin and debauchery
        Making drunkards acquiesce to vices tacitly
        For it is their shortlived happiness.
        Come to Christ, who gives pepetual happiness
        And above all eternal life hereafter.

        Sitting and looking at monument
        Obviously in a pensive mien
        It came unfoldingly – man!
        God has made you king of circumstances and nature
        Had the mortal foe given you its nature
        What have you in heart and mind?
        To do God’s will is all you mind
        What in the heart had taken root?
        Whither thou goest the good or bad route?
        A sinner in sin surely needs the savior
        Who can save from sin grievous sour
        Christ who from above came the savior
        Bounds indissoluble are by his sundered
        Though fortune is inconstant and tempers are soured
        No tyranny of circumstance or mortal foe
        Can dissuade you to sin throes
        Put it in mind also
        In Jesus's love we can make heaven
        Even at the ineveitable hour
        As our wane life wan off
        To meet him across the azure.

      <pre>
        Philosophers may prate there is no hell
        'Foolosophy' has warped their knowledge well
        This they uphold to make a name
        But the rich man says '…i am tormented in this flame'.
        The possibility and credibility
        Could be prove by scientific study
        By laws of logic , and by rules of reason
        The rich man in hell as Bible says is for all a lesson
        A man in eternity a man with a tale to tell
        At this moment he is in pain in hell
        Not "just a grave" as the Jehovah's witnesses alibi
        Not "annihilation of souls" as the 7th day Adventist's lullaby
        Hell is a real, literal and actual place
        Listen there is a Heaven to win and a Hell to shun
        For in hell the torture is more than being put inside the sun
        A place of unparalleled suffering and torment
        As the rich man still testify to this moment
        A place of an unforgettable past
        In which you listen to the play back of your own memory
        A place of unanswered prayers, unsatisfied desires
        The Belshazzars will not have their wine
        The Ahabs will not have their Naboths vineyards
        The Felix will not have their Drusillas
        The Herods will not have their sensuous dances
        The Judas will not have their cancered gold
        They cry in bitter,blitthing voices
        One song , one note ,one cadence, one refrain
        Forever, forever forever forever
        With their burning faces, glazed eyes and tortured hands
        Despair, despondency, disaster, death, yea doom
        I have penned this pungent poem
        To you and to them.

      <h2 class="font-weight-normal" id="d11">Alcohol</h2>

      <pre>
        At first he drank happily
        Then he drank heavily and habitually
        First he drank delicately
        Then drank daringly
        First he drank proudly
        Then he drank ploddingly
        First he was care free about it but soon he was crushed by it
        A dishelled, depraved derelict drunkard.
        Alcohol mightily merciless and murderous
        Bringing broken families and abused children
        With a condemning conscience and  dissipating dearth.
        A lamentable alcoholic life and sin sated soul
        Makes you a hardened sinner, God says
        In the bible …all have sinned.
        Are you a drunkard lying in your vomit
        And in your stupor in the gutter
        An alcoholic who shuffles up the street
        Asking for death dealing alcohol, making the mind to stray
        With pernicious practice of lust and licentiousness
        The word of God  brings conviction
        That JESUS died for your salvation
        From sin sated sin shackled and sin sickened soul
        But heard in every wail of woe
        And behind every sin and sorrow
        The gun, the knife, the deadly deed,
        The satanic scheme and unkind cutting words
        And the whole world godless greed
        Is what the alcoholic breed.
        Though their sin is more than
        A woeful word, a damnable force
        Through Jesus, alcohol is a conquerable foe
