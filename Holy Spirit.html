        The wind is still blowing again
        Which the early penticostal gained
        Powerful current in precedented ways
        Through the strings of mortal souls
        Beaming in Christ a life gay
        In all clime and nation hill and dale
        The bastion of the devil
        Have been defeated from evil
        Behold the power has come
        To, the rich and peasant He becomes
        Have the salvation of your priceless soul
        Has He been breathed into you?
        To make you wrestle for men's soul
        Lifting many a man from fiery abyss
        Whose ways and manner of life is amiss
        Who by substility satan's swade
        But sacrificial love have Him stayed
        He is that make God's wrath stay
        If He be taken, even now, today
        Then shall hell be let loose
        A time of apostacy and sin it may
        And acts of war let loose
        He, is, who sparks the fire of love
        And make man, give His life for the lord
        Man's bone were aforetime dry
        But His breath makes them live
        At this age of the last days
        Behold, the spirit of truth is come
        The third of the triune now beckons
        Opening for us the treasures of God's love
        Bequeathing to His church spiritual gifts
        Manifesting in vigorous congregational life
        Setting man into a living torch
        The power has come the kingdom is dawn
        In a breath taking pageant of conquest
        Injecting streams of life to His born church
        Which flows as rivers of living water
        Oh have you tasted the living water?
        And His word which is living and lucid
        And His gift which is a boom and blessing
        His works are gleaming vanguard of God's grace
        Like cooling drops of water on fevered face.

      <img src="praise.jpeg" alt="image not found"  id="right" style="width:50%; height:300px;">
      <pre>
        The psalmist offered praises to His glory
        Because He died that we might be Holy
        All living things gesticulate to His honour
        For he had, to nurture bestowed pleasure
        Pouring down His blessings-a great boom
        For all unsaved and saved from sin and future doom
        Salvation is His greatest work for us
        That is why unto Him we sing a chorus
        with all the trumpets, flutes and fife
        In every circumstances of life
        Is life today a Psalm of praise?
        Despite our ingratitude and His ever abundant grace?
        Some, like nine lepers of old by Him cleansed
        Had forgotten Him and rejected being a saint
        Recieve Jesus and praise Him in your body and soul
        Your gratitude to Him through thick and thin makes you His own.
        The skeptic say this we do to avoid reality
        But it is the way of confronting reality
        It is giving credit to whom credit is due
        For this cause His blessings comes as the dew
        What shall I give for His care and love
        It is praise and many more
        The continual offering of it requires stamina
        Our reciprocity, it's God's own manna
        He takes away depression and makes us normal.

      <pre>
        Law, Love and Grace
        Gives life to mortal face
        Life wisdom and joy
        All along the time of mortal days
        God the father, the supra power
        God the son, the good shepherd
        God the Holy Spirit, the conforter
        God is waiting to welcome sinners
        Jesus Christ is seeking and saving
        The Holy Spirit is convincing and restoring
        The word of God makes me sure
        The blood of Christ makes me safe
        The Holy Spirit makes me sound
        In the will of God my holiness is purposed
        At the cross of Christ it was made posssible
        By the Holy Spirit it is made feasible
        In God's beehive there are no drones
        In Christ's own army no retirement
        And the Holy Spirit turns potentiality to actuality
        God works immutably and inexorably by law
        Jesus Christ works by unfanthomable love
        The Holy Spirit works by divine Grace
        Unto this three in one shall my service
        Be whole time, whole-man and whole-heart
        And when the trumpets sound for rapture
        Setting free man from mortal foes
        The faithful flock shall they rapture
        To the new Jerusalem, souls celestial shore
        Let this in mind also.

      <img src="prayer.jpeg" alt="image not found"  id="right" style="width:50%;">
      <pre>
        It is in itself a science,
        To be learned and lived.
        The issue of a tranquil mind,
        Of untroubled thoughts.
        The condition of an enlightened mind
        And a surrendered heart.
        Communing with God in the Spirit
        Taking time fore-lock
        On interceding and trivailing knees
        Prayers of faith go to God swiftly
        It is the golden link
        Of man to God's feet
        "And satan trembles when he see"
        The weakest saint unpon his knees
        A time of charity offered with meekness
        Prayer is the balm for all the ills of the soul
        My native tendency an innate activity
        My native air and vital breath
        That gives my soul life in Christ
        Giving me the absolution of sin
        Keeping me in tryst with Christ
        In shining sun and stormy cloud
        Highest ascension comes from lowest contrite heart
        A Christian battle is best done upon the knees
        For zeal without prayer is wasted energy
        On our knees faith and fervency spells victory
        Prayer is a heart suppliant
        Seeking for fresh supply of strength,
        And come forth braced for duty and trial
        Against many a mortal foe
        Let this in mind also
        In spring, a cheery tree blosoms
        So is prayer to my body and soul's bosom
        The act of love on the knee to the near and dear
        We come to God, in adoration, penitence and petition
        Thanksgivinig and intercession.

      <pre>
        No man is greater than his prayer life
        Through it he overcomes the sins of Life
        When we are not praying we are playing
        Let us start praying to avoid straying
        Some prefer to be players and payers
        But who will join those active in prayers?
        That has visions and passion
        To win souls is their mission
        With fellowship that is prayer conditioned
        Spirituality as the condition.
        Preaching affect time, prayer affect eternity
        As soldiers we pray and gain victory
        True prayer is spiritual promotion
        Don't forget consecration by fostering competition and propaganda,
        Begin Gospel propagation
        For synthetic religion must go
        Lets all agree and say so
        The amen corner must not pass away
        Zeal for street meeting will not evaporate
        Our sufferings, prayers, will ameliorate.

      <img src="repentance.jpeg" alt="image not found"  id="right" style="width:50%;">
      <pre>
        The throwing down of weapon of rebellion against God.
        And crossing the bridge over a gorge
        It does not save; none can be saved without it
        From a contrite heart, it comes not by merit
        It is an act preceeding believing
        Christ alone does the deliverance
        Not regret for sin, which comes from the devil
        It is not remorse; hell is full of remorse
        And all that are there know the pain utmost
        It is not conviction, a convict may not repent
        The conviction confession and conversion is all that is meant
        It is not fear of hell many go to hell with their fears
        If you don't repent, to hell you are very near
        It is not simply sorrow, many sinners are in sorrow
        Godly sorrow works repentance
        The escape way is the way to heaven, it is narrow.
        After absolution of sin for your penitence
        It is from a lowly contrite heart
        Confession that can put you and sin apart
        Inspired by firm fire of divine love
        Who is the expression of God's love
        That bring about our redemption
        A deep vocal confession
        A heart forsaking of sin
        And acknowledgement of God
        A total surrender to him.

        The bible suffers from its exponents
        Today than from its opponents
        On pulpit are pearls of intellectualism
        Putting up as a show-strange mannerism
        Glamorous with the silks of philiosopy
        Enchanting with the tiara of psychology
        We need Gospel spawn of sincerity
        A gament from heaven in humilty.
        Sermons of hermeneutics perfection
        Without aunction can't give justification.
        Unction on you? You are God's knighthood
        The bishops hand is not the medium
        From heaven it decends like dew
        Illuminating your heart against evil
        Making you to know, you need regeneration
        Delivering you from familiar spirits
        Because of the presence of the Holy Spirit
        You are set free from spiritism
        You are made spiritual
        Beware of powerless preaching born in tomb
        Instead of the womb
        It is unction that brings his presence
        As you are
        Subdued by His omnipresence
        Staggared by His omnipotence
        Silenced by His ominscience
        And solemnised by His holiness.

        Christ saved me
        Under the shade of Melancholy bough

        Now I am aflame with glitering rime
        In proving my life with fleeting time
        Lo! Christ with divine blood, bought
        Me, that was under the throes of the devil

        A new light in my life is shining
        A new hope of life hereafter is dawn
        A new life from now I live
        No space and time can dim our love
        His love bought love
        Shall land me in eternity sure
        Thus is my heart stayed upon God
        Fret! not Lo! He keeps me company
        Enjoying I the ties as of many
        Though this life is full of perils

        Blustering of pride, brought my heart to a fault
        Satan worked to bring my life to naught
        With all illness - precipitating and misery-producing
        I almost had a blow of fate, that sins were inducing
        But Christ cheerful assurance strenghtened my faith
        And His calmed diagnosis calmed my fear
        In all time and tide He was near
        His operation brought me good health
        Now I have outran and outputted sin
        Christ spared me the nonsense and nuisance of sin-cancer
        His presence is an animating span of time
        Which vindicates His love rich concern
        With a new lease of life
        My horizons and visions broaden
        I am now off the bed of sin and on a rosy bed of His love
        Now I am out and around devoid of sin
        My life is no longer like a flower born to blush unseen
        Nor waste its sweetness on the desert air
        The anticipation for heaven is now rosy
        The name Jesus Christ
        Is the name that gives power to His own
        The potentate greater than mortal foes
        Put it in mind also.

        "Be not drunken with wine
        Where in is excess
        But be filled with the Spirit"
        What a constrast!
        A daring and unexpected conjunction
        Filled with the Spirit- filled with wine
        Inspiration- intoxication
        Pentecost - potation
        The Spirit makes one a sober temperate teetotaler
        Wine make you worst than a useless drag in society
        The Spirit makes you the salt and light of the world,
        Wine anchors you on quick sand of morbid superiority
        The Spirit increases your faith, hope and love
        You need salvation to get the Spirit
        Just a walk down to the bar, you have wine
        With the Spirit you can say, "Oh God, I am thine"
        To wine drunker satan says, "you are mine"
        In the bar where you pay for wine
        Your life becomes short and death is sure
        Wine is the cause but the Spirit is the cure.

        I am a child of God, the God of faith
        Faith is my soul's hand grapsing God's promises
        My soul's eye, looking unto Jesus
        There is no faith without confession.
        Faith keeps life, unbelieve saps life
        Faith is a corner stone of salvation
        For by grace through faith is justification
        Faith knows, believes and trust
        Affirms, testisfies and witness to truth
        Faith is my key to God's blessing
        Exonerating me from cares and fretting
        Faith confession create reality
        Akin to hope in my human breast
        Faith and works goes pari passu
        And act vis-a-vis and attitude
        Without it God is never pleased
        Faiths fans the stimuli of God's grace
        Revealing the will of God
        For the will of God is knowledge
        Doing the will is achievement
        Faith is the key that unlocks
        All the misery of the God head
        Faith knows that he is a child of light
        Having heritage of glorious sight
        In temptation faiths stands me in good stead
        And paves my way to success and victory

        The unmeritted favour
        The undeserved kindness
        That is Grace
        Bringing the best and good
        Gifts for the giver is God
        The finest expression of His love
        The hall mark of His concern
        In her The power forgiveness and acceptance
        She's the expression of God's rescue
        Proceding as He was scheduled
        She's priceless
        Being bought by precious blood
        Grace goes with Gospel
        Giving to who believes in His cleansing blood
        She's a gift, freely recieved, never achieved
        She's not a wage, not an award, not a price
        But the soul refreshing freedom to serve
        God in word and world as we are saved
        That is Grace.

      <pre>
        Sublime unmeritted favour for man from God
        Bestowed to individual person
        To all and sundry, not only those that Matters
        The realised hope of life hereafter
        That brings His eternal precedence
        Making the saved a citizen of one city
        The infinite and eternal heaven
        And an alien in this temporary and transistory earth
        The cleansing and boycotting of propensity to sin
        The outward appearance of inward regenerated soul
        it is the great aesthectic and artistic misery
        Doubly welcomed by lost souls
        It is the nature of super moral perfection
        Salvation is the steping stone to God
        An inherent vis-sicitude of sinnership to saintship
        An operation give and take
        We give out sin, we recieve salvation
        The magnifying glass that concentrates God's love and grace
        Salvation is spiritual blood transfusion to sinners
        To give him life hereafter cast and all
        Not by attainment but by atonement
        Not on the ground of human merit but on divine mercy
        Not by new start but by new heart
        Not turning a new start but turning a new life
        Not what you do but what He has done
        Not developing yourself in character
        But enveloping yourself in Christ
        Know and do this to save yourself from mortal foes
        Put it in mind, in verse or prose.
