      <img src="paul&silas.jpeg" alt="image not found" style="width:50%; height:550px" id="right">
      <pre>
        There was a man - 'Valentine Burke',
        An old time buglar
        With Kilt and guns
        Always ready to hit and run.
        The same, in prison, read in a paper
        "How the jailer of philipi got caught"
        It tells of the amazing work
        of Christ in Paul and Silas
        That were jailed for good works
        As they prayed and sang
        As the book of truth records
        The prison were shakened, the door opened
        by a great earthquake from the Lord God
        The jailer, thinking, all had escaped
        Was about to end his life and end it all
        Paul said with a voice aloud
        "Do thyself no harm: Here are we all"
        The jailer amazed, desired the greatest wish
        "What must I do to be saved"
        Paul with the annointing of the Holy Ghost said
        "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
        And thou and thine house shall be saved"
        At this, Valentine gave himself to Christ
        Like the jailer of phillipi
        Like Valentine Burke, I beseech you come to Christ
        He will develop your personality
        Improve your proficiency
        Realise your prospect
        And increase your prosperity
        And above all, He will give you eternal life
        For a man can make or mar his life.

      <img src="cross.jpeg" alt="image not found" style="width:50%; height:550px" id="right">
      <pre>
        Our sins deserve eternal doom
        But christ for us went to the cross
        To take on himself our fate and gloom
        Crucified, no death was so thorough
        No shame was so complete.
        To set us free from death, He took this way so rough
        Stripes and bruises was his body replete
        With the flogging and scourging post
        This he did for us with love ultmost.
        For our iniquity he was bruised and chastised
        The body became rigid of knotted muscles
        No gentle massaging hand to see.
        Colour drained from his lovely cheeks,
        That  were drawn tight to  the teeth
        With cummulative pain no moment of respite
        Sweat burst from the brow and stung the eyes.
        The sun shone directly on His beautiful eyes
        Oh! Jesus my hope; for me offered up.
        Instead of water they gave him vinegar
        The macabre scene was played out
        He humbled Himself, obedient unto death;
        Unto God the father, he commended His spirit
        The deed was done;
        Which shook the earth and veiled the sun.
        Hallelujah! Up from the grave He arose to reign
        His death was the end of a foul deed
        Schemed for; cunningly contrived
        And above all fiendishly achieved.
        It is the crown of His sublime deed
        Planned in Heaven, wrought on earth;
        And gloriously consummated on cross
        A glance at the cross saves, the gaze of it sanctifies
        For now, I feel my Lord's atoning blood
        Close to my soul applied
        Me, you He loved - the Son of God
        His resurrection provides us with power
        For me, for you He lives to pardon.

      <img src="humility.jpg" alt="image not found" style="width:50%" id="right">
      <pre>
        Humility - the perfection of man's nature
        Making God to be all
        The sense of man's nothingness
        Which comes as seeing God to be all.
        Rooted in the spirit of lowliness
        Christ is humilty personified
        The root from which God's grace grow
        The only soil in which His grace root
        And the tree can't do without the root,
        Is your root pride or humility?
        Wither  do you choose?
        The ball is in your court
        Humility is the glory of God's creation
        The first duty, and highest virtue of creatures.
        A nobility  deeper than contrition
        Primal to the meek and lowly lamb of God
        Lack of it is in the root of sin and evil.
        Old serpent fell from it's glorious pinnacle
        Breathing the poison of pride to heart of man,
        Who hitherto fell from his high position.
        Pride - the gate, births and curses of hell.
        But the loop-hole is the restoration of humanity
        Which the meek and lowly lamb did.
        His humilty is the salvation
        Expelling all malcontent in saved souls,
        Lock, stock and barreled against mortal foes;
        Let this in mind, also.

      <img src="silentnight.jpg" alt="image not found" style="width:50%" id="right">
      <pre>
        All stars in there full brilliances
        And the moon in its radiance
        The night was calm, cool and conducive
        Suddenly; momentarily the silence was broken
        Not with the alarm of war or shout of applause;
        But God's angel praising God, the highest
        Who to them broke the good tidings;
        "For unto you is born ...Christ the Lord"
        It was a remarkable day in annals of human history
        As the shephard hastened to bade the saviour welcome
        Oh you sinful and sleepy prodigal'
        In the silence of your night hear
        The voice of your conscience and
        Decide, "I will arise and go to my saviour"
        That same night the three magicians,
        Watching on top their tower,
        The star of God's son held them in consternation
        Not waiting for the day to dawn
        They went to worship he who is born king of kings
        Angels bestowed their ministry in that silent night
        To who was born of Holy Ghost begotten of God.
        The night was the expression of God's love
        The hallmark for his concern for souls.
        It made all creatures of the earth at peace with joy
        The night that toll the knell of sin and death,
        Silently liberating man from throes and thralldom

        God the son whom for His love
        Came into this world, in form of virgin birth
        Lived a virtuous life, died a vicarious death
        And on the third day had a victorious resurrection
        All to save from hell, man's soul.
        The testimonies of His coming
        Are complete, consistent and conclusive
        His words are axioms, alive with authority
        He spoke in argument, motive an command
        Do you understand His arguments?
        Do you appreciate His motives?
        Do you obey His commands?
        Adam brought death, He brings life
        His love took the place of law and brought joy
        Gracious with tact to worst sinnners
        He came as an offering and sacrifice for our sins
        His death was vicious, official and certified
        His resurrection is "the best proven fact of history"
        To liberate us from sin and purchase our pardon
        By all who appreciate his redemptive work
        His life is the living epistle to be learned and lived
        He came to march man's feet and soul, God-ward
        To this paramount purpose
        He was whole time, whole man and whole heart
        In Him is the Way back to God
        The TRUTH for every bend and road fork
        The LIFE all along to heaven our home
        He is the opened door of mercy for the age
        And a door of hope for the young
        He is the expression of God's love
        The hallmark of his concern for souls
        Call Him into your life
        And he shall toll the knell of sin and death
        In your life and above all
        Make your life soberly, righteously and Godly
        And eternal life is yours, hereafter.

        Christ came from His heavenly throne,
        To make turbulent men, salvation prone
        So that all and sundry can be His own
        He was born contrary to the law of life;
        His love brought Him, a virgin birth for a virteous life
        The atmosphere damped with sin
        Could not wet or cling to His skin
        He was clothed with the garment of righteousness
        In a stable on a manger as His cradle.
        A baby calm, cheerful, cool, and collected
        Content and celebrated
        For His remarkable disposition
        Born to stand forth upon the highest pinnacle of heavenly glory
        His entrance to the stage of the world was pious and Goldly
        Though He encountered many a cross and difficulty
        He was all spotless, radiating God's beauty;
        He was amiable, appproachable and accessible
        For His blessings which He gave the three magicians and shepherds
        The shepherd came to bade Him welcome,
        To us all for righteous life He beckons
        To see the saviour, the three magicians set on their Way
        Christ moon arose to lighten their path way;
        And His bright star directed from the east, their Way
        The bethlehem baby, is the way and, not a plan or creed,
        His birth is unique, His purpose is unique
        The baby unlimited in power, unparalleled in glory
        Simple as breathing, inevitable as sun rise
        In infancy He startled king Herod who could not kill Him
        Man is drugged by sin and satan

        It is being connected with good living
        It is everyday, filling up to par
        A life of exhilirating and ethusiatic journey
        Through a golden avenue of days
        For his beloved, humming a happy tune
        For those who are rid of sinful things
        It is hard to shrug those facts off
        The life is a full blueprint of Godliness
        Being liberated out of doldruns of sin
        And the drawbacks of its throes and thralldom
        Living in christ, breads and butters life
        Living in christ is heaven-on-earth
        A life that is commited to Christ
        Is doubtly sure of it's dreadfull wrong life of sin
        Twice as bothersome it makes amends to Christ
        A spick and span life whatsoever does not steel(harden) itself
        The recipe for it is righteousness at all time
        And nothing in life will cause a ripple
        Everything is a thing of beauty that thrills
        And walks down an avenue of peaces and relief

        High above the azure skies
        Is the land of the celestials
        Where the omnipresent, omniscience
        And the omnipotent Godhead stays
        A place where death ushers the saints to
        Who Lived godly lives of days
        True thought of the life that is to come
        Clothe the life that now is
        Christ standard is to be attained
        And that life after demise
        Is not moaned or is bemoaned
        The mind can't comprehend
        Our home unspeakable beauty
        It is a place of incomparable external
        As well as internal beauty
        Lo! Above it is the perfection of beauty
        Perfection of form colour sound and all
        A place of high holy ennobling companionship
        For the purest noblest, sinless fruit of earth
        Awaited by the founder high priest
        No breaking hearts for cheek glow ashen
        No heavy mind for eye glaze
        No watching the undertaker as he screws
        Down the coffin lid on the belove
        Bless me! no black dress and veils
        No funerals no dirge no grave
        No standing by a yawning grave
        Watching a coffin lowered into it
        No listening to the cold clods
        Falling remorselessly onto it
        The journey to this celestial city
        Starts now with breath on and soul propensity
        Agog, aware of where to rest
        On wither home, Heaven or Hell?
        Behold at anytime of the year
        Over and past is satan's gloomy reign
        The happy time of hallelujah songs is near
        When we are claded with christ glorious might
        When times ceases, when earth and sky
        Rings in memory lane of days gone by
        We rejoice together still from age to age
        Acclaiming our heavenly sacred heritage
        Eternally established above is christ throne
        He is the builder and the architect alone
        And the angels and saints shall intone
        Christ owns praises and blessings only.

        Unique in every sense of the term
        He was born contrary to the law of life
        His death is contrary to the law of death
        He lived in poverty
        Poorer than a church rat
        He posses neither wealth
        Nor any social prestige
        But was content and celebrated
        For his remarkable disposition
        "In infancy He startled a king"
        In childhood he puzled doctors
        In manhood he ruled the course of nature
        He walked upon the waves as pavements
        And hushed the sea to sleep
        He had no bakery or fisheries
        But he spread a table for five thousand
        And have bread and fish to spare
        He healed the multitude without medicine
        And made no charge for his service
        He wrote no books but books are written of him
        He wrote no songs but songs are written of him
        He never practiced psychiatry
        Yet he has healed more broken hearts
        When he died few men put on sack cloths
        But a black crepe was hung over the sun
        Thou men trembled not for their sins
        The earth beneath them shook under the load
        And all nature honoured Him
        Corruption could not get hold of His body
        The soil reddened with His blood
        Could not claim His dust
        Once each week the wheels of commerce
        Cease their turning and multitude
        Wend their way to worship.
        Assemblies to pay homage to Him
        Though time has fleeted the conscience
        Of His crucifixion
        Yet He still lives
        Herod couldn't destroy Him, grave couldn't hold Him
        Now He stands forth upon the highest
        Pinnacle of heavenly glory
        Proclaimed of God
        Acknowledged by angels
        Adored by saints and feared by devils
        Give your life to this unique Christ
        Who has crossed the world's horizon?
        And you can while blissfully the rest
        of your days.

      <pre>
        Truth is not an esoteric philosophy
        Meant for the stoic philosophers
        In as much as He is invisible
        The lips of the truthful shall be establish
        He proves to the hilt and brings to book
        All evil deeds and motives
        With His potent and vocal force
        Truth is the rock of ages
        He stands without a tremble
        While raging waves pounds on,
        Only to be smashed to pieces
        He laugh at all attempt to discredit Him
        To those that are not kindly disposed to Him
        He lies both in words and relationship
        He is an impenetrable citadel to His adherent
        The bible is an epitome of Him
        Don’t doubt, quibble or deny Him
        For the aftermath is very perilous
        Lie is devil-born and sin-coddled
        So dump it all at His throne of grace
        For  He is so over reign
        He acts and that settled it
        He speaks and that is the final
        He is timeless forever true!
        He may be castigated , maybe conceited
        May be condemned, He is always true
        The mighty matchless message
        Meant for this day and age
        With Him heaven as your hope
        Shall become heaven home.

        Gentled, riding on a donkey
        His way to glory was met with praise
        Not with applause of parade or support of fame
        He rode on , the king of kings
        Without jeweled crown
        Tranquilly and modestly on a tiny creature
        As the embodiment of humility, His nature
        Slowly He move for the feeble and little to keep pace
        Gentle He is to all kind of race
        His voice open, receive and welcoming
        All and sundry with love unrejecting
        Heart broken guilt
        Find it natural to come to Him
        Walking with Him riding to glory
        They come confessing, He forgives
        They come weeping He consoles
        And becomes near Him as His own
        He rode on, heading not for coronation
        But for the green hill of gethsemane
        To Golgotha and the cross mainly
        The children with joyous mood cheers
        As their elders panicking heart fear
        At Golgotha spectators becomes serious seeker
        As His life seeds new life to all
        His way to glory was through death
        As seeds to ground and become new life
        Bringing forth many of it kind as fruit
        So all that comes to Him are His fruit
        Seeing that by law sin end with death
        His, was not martyrdom, but an act of atonement
        Which bring eternal life to His fruits.
