      <pre>   
        Lo! We live in a shrinking world
        Gone are times of barbaric superstition
        When the dead sucks the living dry
        Civilization has taken of part of the eye's scale
        Who can do the rest – Christainity?
        For it makes man God's image
        Those who stick pragmatically to vain tradition
        Are the remnant and saints of fools?
        Tradition has ossified the world to death
        In pursuance of shadow instead of substance
        Religious taboo has branded and blinded many
        Who are in fetters, in the devil's company?
        The pulpit and pew can't offer salvation
        In Christ only we have our redemption
        It is easy to say, "I have not heard His clarion call"
        Haven heard, there is no excuse
        For haven had your life abuse.

      <pre>
        Born in the resurrection power
        Formed fashioned by His power
        And grown in the heat of apostolic power
        She is an organism not an organisation
        Created out of Revelation, that He is God the son.
        The living divine incarnation of Christ
        That is of heavenly origin
        The only institution on the shores of time
        That is perpetually eternal,
        To be rapture on the eve of closing of time
        Beyond the sky to the heavenly Jerusalem
        She is part of Christ body and His habitation
        As the cycles of eternity roll on unending
        Her history is half the biography of Christ
        The world is God’s creation as a creator
        He is God’s creation as a life-Giver
        He is an offspring of God born in Christ
        He is an embodiment of heavenly elements
        He bears God’s image
        A mirror reflecting the divine perfection
        And God views his own likeness in her
        She feeds on heavenly food
        And breathes the atmosphere of heaven.
        God and Christ in man is the Church
        The wisdom, love and acts of God is obvious in Her
        He is all spotless fair, radiating God's beauty
        Angels bestows their ministry to him
        Who is Holy, Spirit filled and Holy-Spirit governed
        He is in the world and the world not in him
        Like a fish in salty ocean, and the fish is not salty.
        Sooner or later time shall clock his rapture
        For a faultless presentation of him to Christ
        The union undiminished as eternity rolls on.

        In the womb where they began
        God called them to be His own
        Through the time and tide of life
        In utmost constancy and sacrifice
        His grace fed their brief life
        They of whom the world says
        A pious and godly race they live
        In this bedeviled world they stay
        Genuinely pious and cultured
        Never thinks with keen edge of vanity
        In head and heart; every sense of it
        For they were haters of sin
        Always calm, cheerful, cool and collected
        With broad mindedness and fellow – feeling spirit
        Modest in success and cheerful in victory
        'Men  not of an age, but for all time'
        Celebrated for truth; remarkable for contented disposition
        They were amiable, approachable, accessible
        For their versatile quality of head and heart
        And spirit purview transcending the mundane
        Lo! they aforetime do sleep
        Haven overcome the mortal foes
        Put it in mind, also.

      <pre>
        The time will come for our deeds to be erected
        For our lives to be evaluated
        For the mark we make to be describe
        What will be said?
        The greatest honor to be bestowed is
        "And he brought people to Jesus"
        A honor that is not restricted to class and creed
        Shall our biography be short and complete as Andrew's?
        'And Andrew brought Philip to Jesus'
        Shall it be long and incomplete as Methuselah's?
        'He live 969 years' without a soul for Christ
        (He that is called to preach
        Let him not stop to be a king)
        Pastor are wind in the spirit
        Blowing were He listed
        Leading the flock of Christ
        Away from the throes, to Christ
        With the Bible and not what he purport
        They know God's will, which is knowledge
        They do His will, which is achievement
        They are among the ones
        Who have overcome thought, tongue and teeth
        And every now and then all alone
        They are learning at Jesus feet
        Hand and heart in all time and tide
        They bring Gospel truth to needy sinners
        The soul-saving, the life changing
        And heaven-gaining Gospel of Christ
        They are ministering angels
        That preaches, project and preserve His image
        They bring springs of living water of arid heart
        God's out stretched hand; a hall mark of His concern
        To suffering sin-bound humanity
        'if any be called to preach'
        'Let him not stoop to be a king'

      <pre>
        This is the word and work of God
        It is God in ink and paper- the bible.
        Jesus Christ is the Bible personified
        It keeps man in the tune with his creator
        A sign post that gears the soul God-ward
        Nothing short of a masterpiece from God
        The book of God's science and art gallery.
        In God's pregnant word
        Our dear lord's token of love
        To our humble human soul
        Is the living and lucid Bible
        It out classes all other book and scrolls
        It out- strip and dwarf other books
        The bread of life it gives is good and whole-some
        For Christians balance spiritual diet
        Its food for thought is interesting and instructive
        So full so deep and so pregnant
        His word is ever relevant
        With stories as old as the earth
        Study with the motto: tarry not hurry
        Like a miner in search of concealed treasure
        Listen, read, mark, learn and assimilate
        Not only for creed but for conduct
        Not only for belief but for behavior
        Though much dust and doubt rise against it
        It is practual and applicable
        It gives hope for life with ringing certainty
        And solutions great dilemmas of life.
        For in it is the way of salvation and eternal life?

        When I was lost He found me –poor lad
        What cost! His blood purchase my soul and all
        Hence fort unto Him I am glad
        To rest when home to me He call
        A wretched sinner he spared
        With his living and lucid word
        That when my body and soul are apart
        And to yonder celestial shore I depart
        I may rest at His own glorious sight
        Longing forward for the home
        That lies awaiting me above
        Come the day when I see
        His face bowing my head and knee
        In ecstacy of the wonderful moment
        As I join the angels in merriment

        We have many organizers
        But few angonizers
        Many for Christ are singers
        But few for Christ are clingers
        Lots of pastors, but few wrestlers
        Who against sin wrest
        Before after many fears
        Preaching repentance with many tears.
        Some go to church to show much fashion
        For the lost they have a little passion.
        Christian books abound because of many writers
        Against Satan who will join the few fighters
        Failing here, we fail every
        We go home empty as we came, no unction
        Unknown tongues flow, what a commotion
        We thought, it makes us new creature
        As it subsides the rattles
        We took it for a revival
        Lo! We are beggared and bankrupt
        We fear if we will be rapture
        Because we are not broken or bent
        How long will it take us to repent?
